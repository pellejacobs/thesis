\section{Distributed databases}

\subsection{Distributed, decentralized and centralized databases}

\iffalse
- to fully comprehend distributed databases, we have to distinguish them from decentralized and centralized databases. baran 1964: in context of networks: distributed vs centralized and decentralized in between
- apply this definition to databases: add examples: one single database: standard example, decentralized: cloudfront CDN by amazon, distributed: bittorrent

\subsection{Advantages of using a blockchain as a distributed database}
\iffalse
- CAP Theorem
 => maybe add a section about database properties in general (CAP theorm) and the blockchain aspect of it (one of the papers mentions this, I think Bitfury)
- general advantages of blockchains as a database: consistency and consensus 
- disadvantages of blockchains: latency and scalability
\fi

\subsection{Examples of distributed databases and networks}

% how does every example do on the CAP theorm, what are other disadvantages

\subsubsection{Git}

% no authority, consensus not automatic => danger for malicious agents

\subsubsection{BitTorrent}

% no update to data

\subsubsection{Non-persistent P2P networks}

\iffalse
- no cap applicable, as not a database
- examples: open bazaar.
