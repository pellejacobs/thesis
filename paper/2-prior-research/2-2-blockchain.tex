In the last few years, the blockchain as a concept has been given a wide range of meanings and definitions. Some explain the blockchain as a history of events, some focus on blockchain as a Bitcoin transaction ledger and some talk about the open decentralized database aspect of blockchains \cite{blockchain-multiple-definitions}. Therefore, this section starts by defining this concept, to avoid any misunderstanding or confusion further on.

This thesis will use the blockchain definition as defined by Antonopoulos (2014) \cite{antonopoulos:2014}: ``The blockchain data structure is an ordered, back-linked list of blocks and transactions.'' (p. 159). There are several aspects in this definition that need further explanation.

\subsubsection{Back-linked lists as data structure}

First of all, a data structure is a ``specialized format for organizing and storing data'' (Rouse 2006 \cite{data-structure}). There are several types of data structures such as arrays, lists, graphs, and trees.

Next, a blockchain is a specialized version of an ``ordered, back-linked list''. A list is a data structure that combines a number of ordered values (Abelson 1996 \cite{abelson:1996}). A blockchain will use back-linking to preserve the order of the values. This means that all values have a reference to the previous value in the list. For a blockchain, this means that every block in the blockchain contains an identification of the previous block.

\subsubsection{Transactions}

The second part of the definition mentions transactions. Transactions are the data objects that store information on the blockchain. There are two types of transactions: monetary transactions and non-monetary transactions.

In a monetary transaction, there is a transfer of value between participants, eg. an amount of Bitcoin. The simplest monetary transaction transfers value from one account to another. However, several blockchains allow custom conditions to be scripted into the transactions. These conditions can be used to imitate for example a crop insurance contract. In this situation, the transaction would only execute if the recipient experiences a drought. Transactions with such a custom condition are often referred to as ``smart contracts'' \cite{Ethereum-whitepaper}.

On the other side, there are non-monetary transactions that store data onto the blockchain. A common use case is the storage of the fingerprint of a document on the blockchain, thereby proving the document had to exist at the time the transaction was included into the blockchain. This case is referred to as proof of existence \cite{proof-of-existence}.

Transactions are the raison d'\^{e}tre of the blockchain. Blockchains are designed to make sure that transactions can be validated, propagated over the network and added to a distributed ledger.

\subsubsection{Blocks}

Every block in the blockchain includes several transactions. The blocks are wrappers for the transactions, so these transactions can be included into the blockchain. The blocks are the ordered values of the back-linked list addressed in the beginning of this section. Each block links to the previous block in the list. Blocks are ordered chronologically. Transactions stored in a previous block are executed before the transactions in a later block and all transactions in the same block are executed concurrently.

To conclude, the blockchain is a chronological list of blocks, with each block containing several transactions.

\subsection{Properties of a blockchain}

\subsubsection{Securing the immutability of block headers}

\iffalse
- need to secure against attacks on the immutability of its blockchain. otherwise, eg. considering a cryptocurrency system, an attacker could spend a coin and afterwards nullify this transaction by transmitting their own version of the blockchain without the spent transaction

- what are consensus mechansisms
\fi

As the Bitfury Group explains \cite{bitfury-pos-vs-pow}, every implementation of a blockchain must secure itself against possible attacks on its immutability. To ensure immutability, blockchains make use of a consensus mechanism. This is an algorithm the different nodes in the network use to agree upon the newest state of the blockchain. Every consensus mechanism is designed in such a way that no malicious node can break the system unless this node has some sort of majority in the network. How this majority is defined, depends on the consensus mechanism.

- what is needed to suggest a new block
- how does this prevent 
- what are advantages and disadvantages
\fi

\paragraph{Proof of work}

\iffalse
- to suggest a new block, an entity needs to solve a random computational problem. This problem is designed as such that this entity, called the miner, has a chance of p% to solve this problem if he controls p% of the computing power currently in the network. If the miner solves the problem, he will be rewards with the relevant cryptocurrency. Consequently, miners are incentivised to provide as much computing power as possible until it is not longer economically interesting regarding the reward. 

- As the Bitfury Group correctly states \cite{bitfury-pos-vs-pow}: "[the] security of the network is supported by physically scarce resources: specialized hardware needed to run computations, and electricity spent to power the hardware."

\fi

To suggest a new block for a blockchain with a proof of work consensus mechanism, a node needs to solve a random computational problem. This problem is designed as such that this node has a chance of p\% to solve the problem if he controls p\% of the computing power currently in the network. Such a node is called a miner. If the miner solves the problem, the miner will be rewarded with the relevant cryptocurrency. Miners will provide computing power until it is no longer economically interesting considering the reward. As the Bitfury Group states \cite{bitfury-pos-vs-pow}: "[the] security of the network is supported by physically scarce resources: specialized hardware needed to run computations, and electricity spent to power the hardware." (p.2)

If a malicious node wants to manipulate a proof of work blockchain, this node would need to control 50\% of the computing power on the network. Therefore, the security of a proof of work blockchain depends on two factors. The first factor is the total amount of computing power in the network, also called the hash rate. A higher hash rate means it is more difficult for a new entrant to suddenly take over the network. Second is the distribution of the computing power in the network. If the total computing power  is concentrated within a couple of nodes, they could effectively work together to achieve a majority share.

The main advantage of a proof of work system is its security, as it is very costly to attack. However, this comes at a steep ecological cost. A lot of electricity and computing hardware is wasted on useless calculations. Therefore, other consensus mechanisms have been suggested.

\paragraph{Proof of stake}

The difficulty to create a new valid block for a blockchain with a proof of stake consensus mechanism depends on the balance a node holds of the relevant cryptocurrency. A node with a higher balance will more easily find a valid block, without having to spend electricity and computing hardware required by the proof of work algorithm \cite{bitfury-pos-vs-pow}.

Proof of stake starts from the assumption that nodes with a higher balance are more invested in the currency and its success. If one node would control more than 50\% of the tokens available, it would be against his own interest to attack the blockchain as he would be hit the hardest. 

The advantage of this system is the absence of wasteful spending. Instead of having to spend \$1000 on specialized mining hardware, you can invest this money in the cryptocurrency itself with the same effect. However, there are several problems with the proof of stake mechanism. It is outside the scope of this paper to discuss these issues individually, but all result out of the fact that the ``proof of stake consensus is not anchored in the physical world (cf. with hashing equipment in proof of work).'' (Bitfury Group, 2015, p22). 

The most valuable cryptocurrency using some variation of proof of stake mechanism is Bitshares. On July 20 2017, Bitshares had a market capitalization of \$300 million \cite{general-market-cap}. This makes it the 14th most valuable cryptocurrency at the time of writing. The fact that the top 13 use a proof of work mechanism, shows how the market better trusts the proof of work mechanism.

\paragraph{Other consensus mechanisms}

Several other consensus mechanisms have been proposed, besides proof of work and proof of stake. An example is proof of storage. Here, a node can create new blocks depending on how many megabytes of storage he provides to the network \cite{proof-of-whatever}. However, none of these other consensus mechanisms have been implemented in successful blockchains. This makes it is very hard to evaluate their viability. 

\subsubsection{Access to the blockchain data}

As explained by the Bitfury Group \cite{bitfury-permissioned}, there are three levels of access to a blockchain. First, there is read access to the data stored on the blockchain. This is the lowest level of access to a blockchain. On a higher level, there is access to propose new transactions to the blockchain. Finally, on the highest level, there is access to create new blocks of transactions and add these blocks to the blockchain.

Depending on the design of a blockchain, different nodes can have different levels of access to this blockchain.

\paragraph{Read access and transaction submission: private and public blockchains}

The first two access levels are intertwined and will be discussed together.

As mentioned by the Bitfury Group \cite{bitfury-permissioned}, there are two options on these access levels. The first option is a public blockchain. This means that there are no restrictions upon reading the data on the blockchain or on submitting transactions. The other option is a private blockchain. Only a predefined list of nodes can directly access the data or submit transactions.

A private blockchain might seem more secure because of the controlled access.  Yet, the Bitfury Group \cite{bitfury-permissioned} shows that several advantages of using a blockchain are lost. First of all, several clients will not have direct access to the blockchain data. They will have to rely on a node with direct access. This works against the decentralized aspect of a blockchain as there are only a limited amount of possible nodes to connect to. Next, as clients need to connect to a node with full access, not only do they have to trust that node, the interaction with that node becomes a vulnerability as well. For example, a ``man in the middle attack'' is possible. This means that when a user tries to interact with the blockchain, a malicious party could intercept this communication and reply with false information \cite{man-in-the-middle}. Finally, only a limited set of computers has access to the transactions on the blockchain, creating the possibility of a human factor intervening in the blockchain operation. This circumvents the reliance of the algorithmically enforced rules of a blockchain.

On the other hand, data on public blockchains can be properly encrypted. This will provide enough security and privacy in most use cases.

\paragraph{Access to transaction processing: permissioned and permissionless}

For the third level, the blockchain designer has to chose who is allowed to accept transactions that get incorporated into the blockchain. The first option is a permissionless blockchain. On a permissionless blockchain, there are no restrictions on the identities of the transaction processors. The opposite is a permissioned blockchain. Only a predefined list of nodes can process transactions. 

The use of a permissioned, public blockchain can be a necessary compromise in situations where compliance is an issue, such as in the financial sector.


\subsection{Examples of blockchains}

\subsubsection{Bitcoin}

% discuss: short introduction, properties, characteristics making it an interesting blockchain

The best-known implementation of blockchain technology is in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 \cite{Bitcoin-paper}. In June 2017, Bitcoin hit a record market capitalization of \$48.8 billion \cite{Bitcoin-market-cap}. It is by far the most popular and best-established cryptocurrency. The drawback of this popularity is the difficulty to change flaws in the system. This results in crises such as the recent block size crisis \cite{Bitcoin-civil-war}.

The Bitcoin blockchain is a public, permissionless blockchain with a proof of work consensus mechanism. This means that everyone has read access to the data on this blockchain, everyone can propose transactions to be added to the blockchain and everyone can start a node to help to accept proposed transactions.

The Bitcoin blockchain uses a basic scripting language to power its transaction processing. This language is only advanced enough to process simple transactions and store short pieces of data \cite{antonopoulos:2014}. On one side, the simplicity of this language could be seen as a limitation of its potential. On the other hand, it is a feature of the Bitcoin blockchain that makes it less prone to attacks.

The Bitcoin blockchain is interesting because of its strong security. In July 2017, the Bitcoin blockchain mining network had a hash rate of around 6.6 exa hashes per second \cite{Bitcoin-hash-rate}. This means that the Bitcoin network is being supported by the equivalent computing power of 1.9 trillion Macbook Pros from 2014. This shows the security of the Bitcoin network. To break the system, one node would need to control half of this computing power, which is quite unlikely. The only conceivable way is to develop a supercomputer that is more powerful than all the computers ever made combined, such as a 50 qubits quantum computer \cite{quantum-newsweek}.

Because the strength of the Bitcoin mining network, it is used by other blockchains to help secure their own network. Namecoin is such an example \cite{namecoin-whitepaper}.

\subsubsection{Ethereum}

Ethereum is another cryptocurrency powered by a blockchain. It is the second most valuable cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of \$36.2 billion in June 2017. While Bitcoin focuses on creating a secure, no-nonsense currency, Ethereum tries to leverage the entire potential of the blockchain. This creates endless possibilities but makes Ethereum also more complex than Bitcoin.

Like the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ethereum blockchain is public and permissionless with a proof of work consensus mechanism. However, there are plans to move to a proof of stake approach in the future \cite{Ethereum-pos-faq}. 

As explained in the Ethereum white paper \cite{Ethereum-whitepaper}, the programming language powering the Ethereum blockchain is Turing complete. Practically, this means that any conceivable program could be written in this language \cite{definition-turing-completeness}.

Because of its wide potential, the source code of the Ethereum blockchain is often copied, adjusted and redeployed for custom blockchain solutions.
