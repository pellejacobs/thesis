This final chapter discusses both general and application-specific proposals to manage collaborative databases. All proposals can be roughly divided into two groups. The first group (proposals \ref{store-on-bitcoin}, \ref{blockchain-distributed-storage} and \ref{notary-will}) focuses on centralized, collaborative databases. The second group (proposals \ref{timestamping-db} and \ref{resource-allocation}) focuses on distributed, collaborative databases.
