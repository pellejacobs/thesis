This final chapter discusses both general and application-specific proposals to manage collaborative databases. All proposals can be roughly divided into two groups. 

Proposals in the first group (proposals \ref{blockchain-distributed-storage} and \ref{notary-will}) focus on centralized, collaborative databases. They focus on the removal of a trusted third party in the storage of data.

Proposals in the second group (proposals \ref{store-on-bitcoin}, \ref{timestamping-db} and \ref{resource-allocation}) focus on distributed, collaborative databases. They focus on solving the immutability and consensus issues without a trusted middleman.
