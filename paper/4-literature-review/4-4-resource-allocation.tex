\section{Storing distributed data onto a blockchain}
\label{resource-allocation}

As discussed in section \ref{store-on-bitcoin}, it is hard to find a viable to store centralized data onto a blockchain. But concerning distributed data, there are multiple use cases that benefit from storing their data directly onto a blockchain. These use cases have several characteristics in common: consensus and consistency are real issues, the low scalability is not a problem as they do not require large amounts of data to be stored, the high latency is not a problem as they prefer consistency over direct availability, and the application does not require delete functionality. 

This section will discuss two use cases
