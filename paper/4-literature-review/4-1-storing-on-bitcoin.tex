\section{Storing onto the bitcoin blockchain}

- very obvious solution would be to store data directly onto a blockchain, eg. the bitcoin blockchain. you would just put all the data, properly encrypted, directly onto the blockchain and it is stored

- various issues arise: 
  - basic functionality is missing that several applications need: you are not able to change or remove data once stored data, to update a file you would have to store the entire file again or store just the change and have your application reading the blockchain create the most recent file.
  - as mentioned in section \ref{subsubsec:blockchain-as-distributed-dbs}, blockchains deal with low scalability, high latency and potential privacy concerns.
  - insanely expensive: 0.0000026 BTC per byte \cite{bitcoin-transaction-fee}. At a current market cap of €2418.09 per BTC, the cost of storage is €6.44 per KB. \cite{bitcoin-market-cap}

- because in a context of centralized database, consistency and consensus as are not issues. Solving these problems is the main selling point of blockchain. Although it might be interesting that blockchain provides consistency, this could also be a problem. Some centralized databases might require delete functionality. This is no possible when using a blockchain

- not viable for storage of normal amounts of data

An obvious proposal is to store collaborative data directly onto a blockchain, for example onto the bitcoin blockchain. A user could encrypt his data and store it onto the bitcoin blockchain using a data transaction. Anyone else with the proper key could access this data, change it and submit an updated version.

However, there are multiple issues with this approach.
