# Ethereum white paper

- starting out with a rough synthesis of the bitcoin blockchain, advantages and flaws
- mentioning of alternative blockchain applications: namecoin, colored coins and metacoins => either: 
    - build your independent network (namecoin)
    - build on top of the bitcoin blockchain (other)
- scripting: possibilities of bitcoin scripting, but also limitations

=> Ethereum: 

- Ethereum accounts: 
    - external accounts: similar to bitcoin addresses: places for participants to store value
    - contract accounts: hold by a contract 
- transactions: (value) transfer from an external account to another account (either external or contract)
- message: transfer between contracts 
- state transitions, code execution, mining

suggested applications of Ethereum: 

- financial, semi financial and non-financial
- interesting use case is decentralized file storage: rather complicated use case though
- Decentralised autonomous organizations 

further: 

- GHOST: to counteract eg. centralization of mining
