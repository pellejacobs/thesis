# public vs private blockchains: permissioned

downside of blockchain = slow and not scalable
upside = security and no single point of failure

problems with permissionless blockchains: (ie. transactions can be approved by anyone)

- no control over transaction processors
- confidentiality issues 
- permissioned = more efficient
- pow is made redundant on private bc

byzantine fault tolerance! 

## private, public, permissioned, permissionless

- public = everybody can read
- private = select people can read bc
- permissionless = everybody can do transaction processing 
- permissioned = transaction processing is limited

=> no combination of permissionless private


## permissioned public
best combination for interaction with clients is probably public permissioned: control over transactions

possible ways of implementation: 

- merged mining => need for specific mining pools to allow your bc to be merged mined with bitcoin
- blockchain anchoring => does not require coop with miners
