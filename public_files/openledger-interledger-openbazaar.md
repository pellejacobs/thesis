# distributed databases in combination with blockchains

## openledger

= combination of websites focused on blockchain tech, not really clear what the connection between all services is... nothing to do with distributed databases though

## interledger

= protocol to enable payments across ledgers / payment technologies
connected to the ripple team (cross border transactions, not necessarily blockchain related)

nothing to do with blockchain, rather "Going Beyond Blockchain with the Interledger Protocol"

## openbazaar

- build in electron ❤️
- rather uses the power of multisignature transactions instead of any blockchain technology
- seems nothing more than a decentralised second hand store clone that just allows anything to be sold, without taking a cut

how are listings preserved if a node goes offline? :|
