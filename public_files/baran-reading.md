# distributed communications - Paul Baran

- interesting definition of difference between centralised, decentralised and distributed networks: 
  - centralised: 1 star node connecting all the different leafs => central node is destroyed, the entire system collapses
  - decentralised: several star nodes connected with each other, with each their own leafs => when a central node is destroyed, only its leafs are disconnected from the network
  - distributed: no central star nodes whatsoever, all the leafs are directly connected to all other leafs => leaf is destroyed, minimal impact on the overall system
  
- continues with simulations of influence of redundancy on the availablily of the network. eg. destrunction of x% of nodes has y% of network still communicating
  => does not seem directly relevant to rest of the thesis
