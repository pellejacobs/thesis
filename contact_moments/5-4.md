# 5th April

postponed to 26th april


## Readings questions:

*ripple*: 

- it seems that there is still need for a central entity to monitor the global network and the UNLs of users 

*interledger*: 

- there seem to be some formulatic inconsistencies throughout the paper. eg. p.6 K for Clock Skew becomes S in formula (6)? and p. 7, equation (7) l_i+1 suddenly becomes l_i? 

## other questions: 

way of working: 

- I'm writing 'markdown chapters': write out the chapter in bulletpoints without thinking about style or sentence structure. the are in ./markdown-paper
    => is it ok to review these or do you need a full text to review? I'm not such a good writer so I don't write so fast, and these markdown chapters are much quicker to iterate upon
