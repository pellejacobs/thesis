## pre-presentation discussion with Vytautas

Continuation of [email conversation ](./20-10-email-conversation-distributed-vs-decentralized.md), focussing on relation of distributed & decentralized with private & public blockchains.

Previously V. stated:

> distributed ledger is more or less the same as public ledger as everyone is welcome to join and decentralized is more or less a private ledger (requires permission).

we discussed whether private ledgers could also be 'distributed', in the sense that although an agent is admitted to the network, it does not mean this agent is to be 100% trusted: still need for data duplication between all nodes, consensus mechanisms... etc ~ distributed, rather than decentralized where the nodes have full confidence in each other and only sync. is an issue.

further, we talked about the actual practical potential of private blockchains, whether they could be useful as they seem to be easily replaced by a normal mysql database. several initially apparent issues with a normal RDB might actually be solved without blockchain eg. authenticity / integrity: you could take the hash from a specific state of your RDB to afterwards check the correctness.

=> this is a very interesting view, which should surely be addressed in **part 2, chapter 3**: current potential solutions for issues of collaborative dbs.

## Feedback on research plan comments

**Vytautas:**

we discussed interesting potential of other blockchain applications, focussing on public APIs:

- putting public databases on a blockchain instead of behind a REST interface
- putting the interaction of payment and data reception on a blockchain, instead of behind a REST interface


**prof. De Weerdt:**

- in part 1 and part 2, focus on literature is essential
  
  => eg. when trying to define blockchain, go as deep as possible eg. by defining what a block is
- don't forget references! both on the slides, as in the research plan itself:

  => keep a record of ALL potential / used references, differentiating 'trusted' (books, articles, papers) and 'untrusted' (eg. online blogposts). Note: if some sources are actually very important to the thesis, consider even writing a paragraph on the background / trustability of this source.
  

- be careful with too much info / sentences on a slides, distracts the audience from listening to the presentation as they are reading the slides.
