# Feasibility of blockchain application as medium for collaborative systems or databases

Thesis introduction by Pelle Jacobs
Promoted by prof. Jochem De Weerdt and Vytautas Karalevicius

# Structure of the thesis

- What exactly do we **define as blockchain** and how does that work? Are there any other examples of distributed ledger technology? What are the possibilities, advantages and disadvantages?

- **Collaborative systems and databases**: what are distributed databases and decentralized databases, current issues and how are these issues currently dealt with.

- In which cases would the use of blockchain be an advantage over the current solutions for collaborative databases? Setup a thinking **framework to evaluate blockchain feasibility on specific issues**.

## What is this blockchain you are talking about?

## What is blockchain?

"Chain of blocks"? However, even over this definition, there is no real consensus, as often distributed ledger technologies are all being marked as blockchain.

Purpose of this part in the paper:

- solidly define the concept of blockchain, differentiating it from the more general concept of "Distributed Ledger Technology", to avoid any misunderstanding in the rest of the thesis.
- clearly explain what the idea of blockchain concludes. How are blockchains set up, how can they be used? _eg. public vs private blockchain, permissioned vs unpermissioned, proof of work vs proof of stake, monetary transactions vs non-monetary, data transactions, smart contracts, etc._
- what are the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a collaborative database based on a blockchain

## Blockchain literature

Although blockchain is a very young field of research, there is some literature worth looking into:

- "Bitcoin" paper by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto
- ...

## Collaborative databases: distributed vs decentralized

With collaborative systems and databases, I will focus on two types of databases used for collaborative systems:

- **decentralized databases**: database that is has information duplicated between different agents: need for consensus
- **distributed databases**: database which is accessible for several agents at the same time. Data might be duplicated for redundancy, but this is not necessarily the case. However, if data is duplicated, there is a need for synchronization.

## Current issues with collaborative databases

I will look into the current issues of these forms of databases. Potential important issues:

- **consistency**: which translates to 'consensus' for decentralized databases and to 'synchronization' for distributed databases
- **structure**: complex databases result in complex and unwieldy structures
- **integrity**: how do are we sure the data is the database is actually correct and authentic? How do we make sure no data disappears or gets maliciously altered?

Further, we will have a look a the current solutions for these issues and how they hold up.

## Blockchain as to the rescue

In the final part of the thesis, I will look into the potential to leverage the power of blockchain to solve the issues with collaborative systems, both existing as new ones that only have a chance of solving thanks to blockchain.

- The final purpose is to set up a framework to evaluate the potential of blockchain for a specific issue based on simple questions: eg. are there multiple parties involved, each with their own incentives?

- A popular hypothesis I am looking forward to evaluate is the following:
_"The true power of blockchain lies in new issues that haven't been solved yet, instead of trying to replace current working solutions"_
