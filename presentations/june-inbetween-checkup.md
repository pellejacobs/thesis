# Progress check June - Pelle Jacobs

This slide deck should cover the following topics. Most of what is mentioned here should not be anything new or shocking, but rather serves as a place to put everything together:

- Revised subject and focus point of the thesis
- Current table of contents of all the chapters
- Current stage in the creation process
- Next steps and commitments

# Small revision of focus point

After many Skype calls and my own research it became clear that it would be interesting to shift the focus point a little bit

- instead of focusing on decentralized data storage with blockchain systems
- more interesting 'how concept of replacing a previously thought indispensable, central entity with technology, can be applied to data storage, resulting in distributed data storage' 

This allows to broaden the focus from only 'blockchain' applications, to also include 'vanilla' public key cryptography which in itself is already a strong force in replacing a middleman.

Although maybe not a huge difference, it gives me a the opportunity to have a different mental approach to the subject

# Table of contents

1. Introduction: rather straight forward: general question and a basic reading guide for the thesis. 
2. Description of current situation in the relevant fields of study (see next slide)
3. Aim of the research: how can the idea to replace the middle man by technology be applied when dealing with distributed databases? 
4. Actual proposals on how to actually merge the idea of distributed data storage

## TOC: Description of the current situation

- public key encryption: a general description and the implications of it
- blockchain: 
    - the definition of a blockchain (as defined by Antonopoulos), the workings of a minimal blockchain, the characteristics of a blockchain (eg. consensus and availability)
    - properties of a blockchain: the differences between blockchain: consensus mechanisms (POW and POS), access to data (private and public), power to accept transactions (permissioned and unpermissioned)
    - examples of blockchains
- distributed dbs: 
    +  difference between the terms distributed, decentralized and centralized and advantages and trade offs of using a distributed databases compared to a fully centralised db or decentralized db
    +  examples of distributed networks and databases and how they achieve consensus (git, torrent, non-persistent p2p networks)

---

## TOC: Aim of the research: apply middleman replacement to distributed db
This idea has actually two ways of approaching it: 

- can this idea be applied to actually storing the data: what would this mean? What would the consequences / resulting situation be? what would the advantages be? what are some possible applications if this would be possible? 
- can this idea be applied to enable interaction between databases, either to achieve consensus between versions of the same database, or in the interactions between different databases

---

## Proposals

- Storing actual data onto Ethereum: as ethereum allows anything, storing data is also possible (at a cost though) => answers approach 1
- Timestamping dbs onto the bitcoin blockchain => answers approach 2
- I would love to work out a complete example of how to replace how a notary handles a will: starting from a simple document that is signed with a private key all the way to an ethereum program that actually publishes the document once deceased.

# Current stage in the writing process

- Content of several chapters has been written in bullet points, and I am daily further writing content down for these chapters.
- These still have to be read by Vytautas however, as I have not yet send them for proof-reading. If this is a priority, I can focus on getting ready what I have and send that through.
- Once most content is done, I will start on actual chapters. I am a slow writer and it would take me even longer if I have to focus on both content and sentence structure.

# What is next

- I have only 5 exams in the coming weeks, which should give me ample time in between to do the needed preps for a possible presentation
- July will be writing month, finishing filling up the framework as described in the TOC part of this slide deck
- Final submission presentation in August, date tbd.
- In the meantime, I'm staying aware of possible additions or expansions. Eg. I have a meeting with the leading Blockchain expert at Deloitte Belgium after my finals to discuss my subject and have his additions. I hope eg. to get more ideas concerning proposals for chapter 4. Also, he brought up IPFS and Filecoin, which I had dismissed as not-viable but might need further research
