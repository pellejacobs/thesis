# Problem statement

Needs to include:

## What is the research about
How can the revolutionary idea of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to replace a previously thought indispensable middleman by technology be applied to improve distributed databases? 

To do this, I will evaluate several proposals on applying this technology to distributed databases:

- how to store data in a distributed way 
- how to achieve consensus between different nodes on a version of the same database
- how to enable interaction between different databases (not necessarily distributed databases)

## Why do I (personally) want to research this

"Blockchain" is a buzzword that everyone seems to be talking about, without actually understanding what it is about. I would to understand what could make an implementation of blockchain technology as powerful as possible. The specific application onto distributed databases seems unexplored and therefore an interesting aspect to approach the subject.

## Why is this relevant / valuable

Blockchain and decentralization are currently incredibly hot. As a result, a lot of proposals are made making it hard to distinguish the valuable ideas from the less interesting ones. I hope this paper will give some background on the current state of blockchain technology and distributed databases and suggest how these two technologies might interact, so the reader can find out 

## What is the context

Not really sure what this should include: 

As the blockchain as a research field is very young, there has not been written a lot on the subject. Therefore, the basis for this paper are the white papers published by the developers of the technologies.

## Methodology 

- the (limited) existing literature
- interviews
- white papers on new technologies
- opinions / reviews / analyses on these technologies by online personas (ie. blogs.)
- personal interpretations in the comparisons of different technologies (does this make any sense?) 

## What won't the research be about

- I will not create a flowchart or decision framework to evaluate general ideas concerning how the blockchain technology
