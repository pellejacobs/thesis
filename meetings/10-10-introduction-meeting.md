# Meeting with prof. De Weerdt and Vytautas

## timeline

- 24th October: seminar presenting the generalities of the thesis => corrected to 21st
- end semester 1: draft with
  - elaborate definition of 'blockchain' as a concept
  - literature study of problems with (current, non-distributed-ledger) distributed database technology. 3 potential issues:
    1. need for consensus (and consistency) between the nodes
    2. need for structure. (not specific enough)
    3. need for integrity
- end semester 2 (may): final version that includes:
  - how blockchain, as a distributed ledger technology (DTL), the issues with distributed databases can solve.
  - what the performance


## planned literature

- bitcoin paper door Satoshi
- ...


## other concepts that came up:

- 'name-coin': current, non-bitcoin implementation of blockchain example
- distributed databases â‰  decentralised database: needs more lookup work to make a difference
- "BC as the real cloud": interesting concept that could use some argumentation




## questions that will need more research in the coming week

To get more familiar with the blockchain concept, there are a couple of questions I'll have to research further.

- What are alternatives for proof of work. eg. proof of stake: what does this include? Other alternatives?
- What is the difference between public and private blockchains? What are some example applications of both?
- Difference between "active peers", "passive peers" and "miners"
