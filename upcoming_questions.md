# Questions! ðŸŽ‰

- what are the alternatives of proof of work? only proof of stake? how does it work? 

- what is the minimum viable blockchain? what are the constraints applied to this minimum viable blockchain? eg. if there is no need for anonimity, which aspects of the standard (bitcoinesque) blockchain are not needed 

  => this is mostly searching for a way around the proof of work: are there conditions in which a blockchain is interesting without the proof of work aspect?
 
- how to hijack existing blockchains? how / when to put your information on an existing blockchain (ie bitcoin, ethereum)

- what's up with the smart contractz?
